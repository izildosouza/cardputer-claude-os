"""Cardputer MCP — device-side endpoint for the cardputer-mcp host
bridge (see /mcp/README.md and /buddy/references/mcp_protocol.md).

Iteration 2. This app:
  - Brings up a BLE peripheral on the `a5cd0001-…` service UUID, advertising
    as `CardputerMCP_<6 hex>`.
  - Parses line-delimited JSON over the RX characteristic.
  - Implements `notify` (visual banner + speaker chirp) and `ask`
    (renders question + choices, waits for 1–4 keypress or ESC).
  - Sends framed acks/events on TX, chunked at 20 bytes.

The BLE init sequence, IRQ pattern, advertise-cascade, and
`gatts_set_buffer` ordering are copied straight from buddy_ble.py —
they encode hard-won lessons about the stripped UIFlow 2.0 NimBLE
build. Don't reorder unless you've also re-run the experiments that
established the ordering; the failures are subtle (silent dropped
bytes, controller wedges that need a power cycle) and won't show up
in casual testing.

The chrome / exit conventions match the other apps in this directory
so the suite feels coherent. UIFlow's launcher does a machine.reset()
to come back, which means each app boots a fresh BLE stack — that's
why we don't have to worry about clashing with Buddy's NUS service.
