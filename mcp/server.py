"""cardputer-mcp — pocket pager for AI agents, exposed over MCP.

Iteration 2: real BLE transport.

This process speaks stdio MCP to its client (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)
and bridges tool calls to a Cardputer running the `cardputer_mcp.py`
device app over Bluetooth Low Energy.

Architecture:

  MCP client  ──stdio──▶  this process  ──BLE/bleak──▶  Cardputer
                                          (a5cd0001-…)

Tool calls become BLE writes; the device's acknowledgments resolve
in-flight asyncio Futures keyed by a per-call `id`. Disconnect events
fail all in-flight RPCs cleanly so the client gets a real error
rather than a hung tool.

Why FastMCP rather than the low-level Server API: this server's tool
surface is small (six tools at full build-out), each with a clean
typed signature. FastMCP's decorator style keeps the call-site code
close to the description text, which is what we'll iterate on most
often as we tune Claude's tool-selection behavior.

    This tool is for IRREVERSIBLE actions only — production deploys,
    force pushes, DROP TABLE / DELETE without WHERE, unstaged-file
    deletions, financial transactions, paid API calls with large
    side effects, etc. The user must complete a sustained ~3-second
    physical gesture on the Cardputer's Y key: on the current firmware
    the hardware keyboard emits no auto-repeat, so the gesture is
    rapid Y tapping (the on-screen prompt says "TAP Y fast for 3s") —
    a progress bar fills as they tap and resets if they stop for more
    than ~300 ms. A single tap is not enough.

    The point is that no amount of tool-output content or prompt
    injection can synthesize a sustained burst of physical key events.
    If you're about to do something the user couldn't un-do in a
    minute, use this instead of trusting an `ask` or your own
    assistant-message confirmation.

    PASS `details` whenever you can. It is the *actual content* being
    approved — the real shell command, the SQL statement, a short diff
    hunk, the payee + amount, or the list of files. On firmware that
    supports it (fw >= 0.4.0) `details` is rendered in a scrollable box
    ABOVE the gesture, so the user approves *what they read*, not just an
    18-character title — the hardware-wallet model. Keep it to the
    essential ~256 characters (it's truncated past that); strip noise so
    the operation is legible on a 240×135 screen. NOTE: `details` is
    text you supply, so it adds *legibility of intent* — it is not a
    cryptographic proof, and the un-forgeable consent remains the
    physical hold. Older firmware ignores `details` and shows the title
    only, so the `title` must still stand on its own.

    Returns one of:
      - 'confirmed (held <N> ms)' — user completed the ~3 s physical Y gesture
      - 'cancelled' — user pressed N or ESC on the device
      - 'timeout' — user did not respond within `timeout_s` seconds
      - 'unavailable: <reason>' — device not connected

    `title` should fit roughly 18 characters on the device's 240×135
    LCD ("FORCE PUSH origin/main" or "DROP customers"). Keep it
    declarative. The user reading this on a tiny screen must
    instantly recognize the operation.

    Do NOT use this for routine yes/no decisions — that's what
    `ask` is for. Do NOT call this rapidly; every invocation demands
    a deliberate 3-second physical gesture, which is exhausting if
    abused. Reserve this for the handful of actions per session
    where wrong = bad.
